# Scientific Calculator (Assignment for TodayPay Placement)
**Overview**
This project is a web-based scientific calculator built using React, developed as part of an assignment for placement by TodayPay. The calculator aims to replicate the functionality and user interface of the macOS Scientific Calculator, including basic arithmetic operations, advanced mathematical functions, and special features like handling previous results and triggering confetti animations for specific operations.

**Features**
* User Interface
* Responsive design resembling the macOS Scientific Calculator.
* Clear display of input and results using the Roboto font.
* Comprehensive set of buttons for basic arithmetic, advanced functions, memory operations, and scientific calculations.
**Functionality**
* Basic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
* Advanced Functions: Trigonometry (sine, cosine, tangent), logarithms, exponents, square roots, factorial, random number generation.
* Special Feature: Confetti explosion animation for operations involving the numbers 5 and 6 as operands.
* Memory Handling: Ability to store, recall, add, and subtract values from memory.
* Previous Results: Utilization of previous calculation results as operands for new calculations.
* Additional Features
* Theme Switcher: Toggle between light and dark modes for different visual preferences.
* History: View history of past calculations for reference.
*Getting Started*
